electron wrapper around chatgpt site. inspired by the scratchpad feature of
i3wm which i found very useful for holding an instance of chatgpt. except out
of habit i would hit the quit window keystrokes instead of minimize scratchpad
window.

this 'app' will stay open via the system taskbar. even if you quit the app via
keystrokes accidentally it will still run in the background.

hit Super(Win) + Shift + Y to show/hide the window

Even though OpenAI has released their own desktop app, it is only available for MacOS, while this wrapper will also work on Linux and Windows ))
